A hobby of mine that I enjoy especally during the summertime is swimming. I live by a beautiful beach in Scituate called Peggoty beach, where I run down the neighborhood streets, and then go to the beach to take a quick dip where I swim. The area where the beach is located is neat and pretty. On days that I am working, I purposefully will take time to do this activity. The run and cold water rejuvinates me when I have low energy, and helps clear my mind.
